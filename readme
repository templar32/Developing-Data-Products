The BMI is used in a wide variety of contexts as a simple method to
assess how much an individual's body weight departs from what is normal
or desirable for a person of his or her height. There is however often
vigorous debate, particularly regarding at which value of the BMI scale
the threshold for overweight and obese should be set, but also about a
range of perceived limitations and problems with the BMI. (Wikipedia)
